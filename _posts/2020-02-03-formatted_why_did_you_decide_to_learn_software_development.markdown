Since my freshman year of high school, I had different classes in engineering. The first one was robotics engineering where I had my first contact with coding. The first days we got to learn the theory of coding and I wasn't impressed by it, I thought it was going to be a hard class. Then everything changed after a few days when we begin coding. Robotics class became my favorite class because of how coding works, for me, it's about finding different ways to improve your code and the rest is on what are you capable of doing.

Years past and I got a new hobby that was streaming while playing different games with friends. Then I wanted to create a website for me so I start to look for how to do it. In a matter of two weeks, I learned the basics of HTML and CSS which I understand but stop when I realize that the next step, JavaScript, was too complicated for me, even though I was genuinely intrigued by it. 

After I finish high school I wasn't sure what career to choose because I never seat down and think hard about it. So I look back and I remember that one thing that had me watching videos countless hours learning and enjoying it. Now, my primary goal is to finish the program, get jobs on big companies and get as much experience as I can. Then, set my own company and keep learning.
