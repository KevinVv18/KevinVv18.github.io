Before I start with my program I wanted to download "Atom" because I saw it easier and though that would make the coding prosses fluent. I wasn't wrong but the main problem that I had was the new version of ruby. This new version had lots of warnings and errors that i didn't understand. Also, I had lots of incompatibility with my gems like Nokogiri didn't support ruby 2.7.0. I had to manually install a pre realize a version of Nokogiri and that took me time to realize the problem and have to solve it. 

Fast-forward to solving all the incompatibilities I had to build my program, this was tricky because in my head I wanted to build a fancy program with different ways to interact with it. All my ideas sound right so I begin to code and then I realize that I have no idea how to code the ideas that I had. That didn't stop me and I did my research and began to code but every new step was getting harder and harder. Then it got to a point where I didn't completely understand my code. That's when I decide to delete all of it and start a new project and code with all my knowledge. 

From there to the end I the coding process was pretty fast although I had some internet issues that I was having but aside from that I manage to finish the project. I enjoy every part of it from the headaches of incompatibility to see that the program works.
